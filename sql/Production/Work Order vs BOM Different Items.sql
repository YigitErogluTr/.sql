/*
    Production Orders vs BOM Consistency Check

    This query compares the Bill of Materials (BOM) with Production Orders (OWOR).
    It highlights:
    - Components that exist in BOM but are missing from the Production Order
    - Components that exist in the Production Order but are missing from the BOM

    Useful for identifying mismatches between BOM structure and actual production orders.

    Notes:
    - OITB item group codes are filtered to specific groups (example: 100â€“111).
    - UDF `U_H1_UretimBolumu` is assumed to represent the production department.
